# Telemt Control API

## Purpose
Control-plane HTTP API for runtime visibility and user/config management.
Data-plane MTProto traffic is out of scope.

## Runtime Configuration
API runtime is configured in `[server.api]`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enables REST API listener. |
| `listen` | `string` (`IP:PORT`) | `127.0.0.1:9091` | API bind address. |
| `whitelist` | `CIDR[]` | `127.0.0.1/32, ::1/128` | Source IP allowlist. Empty list means allow all. |
| `auth_header` | `string` | `""` | Exact value for `Authorization` header. Empty disables header auth. |
| `request_body_limit_bytes` | `usize` | `65536` | Maximum request body size. Must be `> 0`. |
| `minimal_runtime_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enables runtime snapshot endpoints requiring ME pool read-lock aggregation. |
| `minimal_runtime_cache_ttl_ms` | `u64` | `1000` | Cache TTL for minimal snapshots. `0` disables cache; valid range is `[0, 60000]`. |
| `read_only` | `bool` | `false` | Disables mutating endpoints. |

`server.admin_api` is accepted as an alias for backward compatibility.

Runtime validation for API config:
- `server.api.listen` must be a valid `IP:PORT`.
- `server.api.request_body_limit_bytes` must be `> 0`.
- `server.api.minimal_runtime_cache_ttl_ms` must be within `[0, 60000]`.

## Protocol Contract

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Transport | HTTP/1.1 |
| Content type | `application/json; charset=utf-8` |
| Prefix | `/v1` |
| Optimistic concurrency | `If-Match: <revision>` on mutating requests (optional) |
| Revision format | SHA-256 hex of current `config.toml` content |

### Success Envelope
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {},
  "revision": "sha256-hex"
}
```

### Error Envelope
```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "machine_code",
    "message": "human-readable"
  },
  "request_id": 1
}
```

## Request Processing Order

Requests are processed in this order:
1. `api_enabled` gate (`503 api_disabled` if disabled).
2. Source IP whitelist gate (`403 forbidden`).
3. `Authorization` header gate when configured (`401 unauthorized`).
4. Route and method matching (`404 not_found` or `405 method_not_allowed`).
5. `read_only` gate for mutating routes (`403 read_only`).
6. Request body read/limit/JSON decode (`413 payload_too_large`, `400 bad_request`).
7. Business validation and config write path.

Notes:
- Whitelist is evaluated against the direct TCP peer IP (`SocketAddr::ip`), without `X-Forwarded-For` support.
- `Authorization` check is exact string equality against configured `auth_header`.

## Endpoint Matrix

| Method | Path | Body | Success | `data` contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/v1/health` | none | `200` | `HealthData` |
| `GET` | `/v1/stats/summary` | none | `200` | `SummaryData` |
| `GET` | `/v1/stats/zero/all` | none | `200` | `ZeroAllData` |
| `GET` | `/v1/stats/upstreams` | none | `200` | `UpstreamsData` |
| `GET` | `/v1/stats/minimal/all` | none | `200` | `MinimalAllData` |
| `GET` | `/v1/stats/me-writers` | none | `200` | `MeWritersData` |
| `GET` | `/v1/stats/dcs` | none | `200` | `DcStatusData` |
| `GET` | `/v1/stats/users` | none | `200` | `UserInfo[]` |
| `GET` | `/v1/users` | none | `200` | `UserInfo[]` |
| `POST` | `/v1/users` | `CreateUserRequest` | `201` | `CreateUserResponse` |
| `GET` | `/v1/users/{username}` | none | `200` | `UserInfo` |
| `PATCH` | `/v1/users/{username}` | `PatchUserRequest` | `200` | `UserInfo` |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/users/{username}` | none | `200` | `string` (deleted username) |
| `POST` | `/v1/users/{username}/rotate-secret` | `RotateSecretRequest` or empty body | `404` | `ErrorResponse` (`not_found`, current runtime behavior) |

## Common Error Codes

| HTTP | `error.code` | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `400` | `bad_request` | Invalid JSON, validation failures, malformed request body. |
| `401` | `unauthorized` | Missing/invalid `Authorization` when `auth_header` is configured. |
| `403` | `forbidden` | Source IP is not allowed by whitelist. |
| `403` | `read_only` | Mutating endpoint called while `read_only=true`. |
| `404` | `not_found` | Unknown route, unknown user, or unsupported sub-route (including current `rotate-secret` route). |
| `405` | `method_not_allowed` | Unsupported method for `/v1/users/{username}` route shape. |
| `409` | `revision_conflict` | `If-Match` revision mismatch. |
| `409` | `user_exists` | User already exists on create. |
| `409` | `last_user_forbidden` | Attempt to delete last configured user. |
| `413` | `payload_too_large` | Body exceeds `request_body_limit_bytes`. |
| `500` | `internal_error` | Internal error (I/O, serialization, config load/save). |
| `503` | `api_disabled` | API disabled in config. |

## Routing and Method Edge Cases

| Case | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Path matching | Exact match on `req.uri().path()`. Query string does not affect route matching. |
| Trailing slash | Not normalized. Example: `/v1/users/` is `404`. |
| Username route with extra slash | `/v1/users/{username}/...` is not treated as user route and returns `404`. |
| `PUT /v1/users/{username}` | `405 method_not_allowed`. |
| `POST /v1/users/{username}` | `404 not_found`. |
| `POST /v1/users/{username}/rotate-secret` | `404 not_found` in current release due route matcher limitation. |

## Body and JSON Semantics

- Request body is read only for mutating routes that define a body contract.
- Body size limit is enforced during streaming read (`413 payload_too_large`).
- Invalid transport body frame returns `400 bad_request` (`Invalid request body`).
- Invalid JSON returns `400 bad_request` (`Invalid JSON body`).
- `Content-Type` is not required for JSON parsing.
- Unknown JSON fields are ignored by deserialization.
- `PATCH` updates only provided fields and does not support explicit clearing of optional fields.
- `If-Match` supports both quoted and unquoted values; surrounding whitespace is trimmed.

| `available_endpoints` | `usize` | Endpoints currently available in this DC. |
| `available_pct` | `f64` | `available_endpoints / endpoints_total * 100`. |
| `required_writers` | `usize` | Required writer count for this DC. |
| `alive_writers` | `usize` | Alive writers in this DC. |
| `coverage_pct` | `f64` | `alive_writers / required_writers * 100`. |
| `rtt_ms` | `f64?` | Aggregated RTT for DC. |
| `load` | `usize` | Active client sessions bound to this DC. |

### `UserInfo`
| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `username` | `string` | Username. |
| `user_ad_tag` | `string?` | Optional ad tag (32 hex chars). |
| `max_tcp_conns` | `usize?` | Optional max concurrent TCP limit. |
| `expiration_rfc3339` | `string?` | Optional expiration timestamp. |
| `data_quota_bytes` | `u64?` | Optional data quota. |
| `max_unique_ips` | `usize?` | Optional unique IP limit. |
| `current_connections` | `u64` | Current live connections. |
| `active_unique_ips` | `usize` | Current active unique source IPs. |
| `total_octets` | `u64` | Total traffic octets for this user. |
| `links` | `UserLinks` | Active connection links derived from current config. |

#### `UserLinks`
| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `classic` | `string[]` | Active `tg://proxy` links for classic mode. |
| `secure` | `string[]` | Active `tg://proxy` links for secure/DD mode. |
| `tls` | `string[]` | Active `tg://proxy` links for EE-TLS mode (for each host+TLS domain). |

Link generation uses active config and enabled modes:
- `[general.links].public_host/public_port` have priority.
- If `public_host` is not set, startup-detected public IPs are used (`IPv4`, `IPv6`, or both when available).
- Fallback host sources: listener `announce`, `announce_ip`, explicit listener `ip`.
- Legacy fallback: `listen_addr_ipv4` and `listen_addr_ipv6` when routable.
- Startup-detected IPs are fixed for process lifetime and refreshed on restart.
- User rows are sorted by `username` in ascending lexical order.

### `CreateUserResponse`
| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `user` | `UserInfo` | Created or updated user view. |
| `secret` | `string` | Effective user secret. |

## Mutation Semantics

| Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /v1/users` | Creates user and validates resulting config before atomic save. |
| `PATCH /v1/users/{username}` | Partial update of provided fields only. Missing fields remain unchanged. |
| `POST /v1/users/{username}/rotate-secret` | Currently returns `404` in runtime route matcher; request schema is reserved for intended behavior. |
| `DELETE /v1/users/{username}` | Deletes user and related optional settings. Last user deletion is blocked. |

All mutating endpoints:
- Respect `read_only` mode.
- Accept optional `If-Match` for optimistic concurrency.
- Return new `revision` after successful write.
- Use process-local mutation lock + atomic write (`tmp + rename`) for config persistence.

## Runtime State Matrix

| Endpoint | `minimal_runtime_enabled=false` | `minimal_runtime_enabled=true` + source unavailable | `minimal_runtime_enabled=true` + source available |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/v1/stats/minimal/all` | `enabled=false`, `reason=feature_disabled`, `data=null` | `enabled=true`, `reason=source_unavailable`, fallback `data` with disabled ME blocks | `enabled=true`, `reason` omitted, full payload |
| `/v1/stats/me-writers` | `middle_proxy_enabled=false`, `reason=feature_disabled` | `middle_proxy_enabled=false`, `reason=source_unavailable` | `middle_proxy_enabled=true`, runtime snapshot |
| `/v1/stats/dcs` | `middle_proxy_enabled=false`, `reason=feature_disabled` | `middle_proxy_enabled=false`, `reason=source_unavailable` | `middle_proxy_enabled=true`, runtime snapshot |
| `/v1/stats/upstreams` | `enabled=false`, `reason=feature_disabled`, `summary/upstreams` omitted, `zero` still present | `enabled=true`, `reason=source_unavailable`, `summary/upstreams` omitted, `zero` present | `enabled=true`, `reason` omitted, `summary/upstreams` present, `zero` present |

`source_unavailable` conditions:
- ME endpoints: ME pool is absent (for example direct-only mode or failed ME initialization).
- Upstreams endpoint: non-blocking upstream snapshot lock is unavailable at request time.

## Serialization Rules

- Success responses always include `revision`.
- Error responses never include `revision`; they include `request_id`.
- Optional fields with `skip_serializing_if` are omitted when absent.
- Nullable payload fields may still be `null` where contract uses `?` (for example `UserInfo` option fields).
- For `/v1/stats/upstreams`, authentication details of SOCKS upstreams are intentionally omitted.

## Operational Notes

| Topic | Details |
| --- | --- |
| API startup | API listener is spawned only when `[server.api].enabled=true`. |
| `listen` port `0` | API spawn is skipped when parsed listen port is `0` (treated as disabled bind target). |
| Bind failure | Failed API bind logs warning and API task exits (no auto-retry loop). |
| ME runtime status endpoints | `/v1/stats/me-writers`, `/v1/stats/dcs`, `/v1/stats/minimal/all` require `[server.api].minimal_runtime_enabled=true`; otherwise they return disabled payload with `reason=feature_disabled`. |
| Upstream runtime endpoint | `/v1/stats/upstreams` always returns `zero`, but runtime fields (`summary`, `upstreams`) require `[server.api].minimal_runtime_enabled=true`. |
| Restart requirements | `server.api` changes are restart-required for predictable behavior. |
| Hot-reload nuance | A pure `server.api`-only config change may not propagate through watcher broadcast; a mixed change (with hot fields) may propagate API flags while still warning that restart is required. |
| Runtime apply path | Successful writes are picked up by existing config watcher/hot-reload path. |
| Exposure | Built-in TLS/mTLS is not provided. Use loopback bind + reverse proxy if needed. |
| Pagination | User list currently has no pagination/filtering. |
| Serialization side effect | Config comments/manual formatting are not preserved on write. |

## Known Limitations (Current Release)

- `POST /v1/users/{username}/rotate-secret` is currently unreachable in route matcher and returns `404`.
- API runtime controls under `server.api` are documented as restart-required; hot-reload behavior for these fields is not strictly uniform in all change combinations.
